## Wonde Tech Test

This is the first time I've used Laravel & Tailwind but I've choosen to use these to complete the tech test to demonstrate how quickly I can pick up different technologies and use them to complete a task. But please expect some beginner mistakes :)

## Run the code
# PHP/Laravel
* composer install
* php artisan serve

# Vite/Tailwind
* npm install
* npm run dev

## Things I'd add but didn't have time
* Maybe a model for a class, students and staff to serialise the results from the API instead of doing it inside the controller
* The date filtering on the Wonde API - the date filtering didn't appear to be changing the results set, but probably not using it correctly.
* Classes table to include more data e.g. what day the class was on, was it the created_date property?
